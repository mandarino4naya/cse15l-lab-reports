Overall, make sure you have at least 3 screenshots, one for each of the steps below\ 
(though more is useful, remember that this will help out your future self).\ 
For each step include 2-3 sentences or bullet points describing what you did.\ 
If for some reason you didnâ€™t do the step exactly, describe why not\
(maybe your computer already had something on it, maybe the department computers worked differently, etc).\
