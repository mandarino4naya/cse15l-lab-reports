Go back and pick a favorite lab report or a lab activity you really liked or did not finish.
Write a post going into detail on how you did the task, doing the task in a different way,
or applying something you learned later to the same task. For example (and you can use these ideas if you like):

For lab report 2 (about StringServer), use jdb to set a breakpoint and answer the questions about the values of variables, fields, and arguments.
For lab report 3 (about find/grep etc) do the same exploration of several options for a different command or commands
For lab report 4 (about doing commands quickly), how could you have done the task very quickly by writing a bash script
(even if that was against the rules)
For lab 6 (about creating a grading script), finish the grading script and take screenshots that demonstrate it working on several files.
(A similar script will be part of the second skill demo, so it’s a worthwhile thing to understand in detail!)
Your own idea, as long as it’s reasonably as in-depth as these options.
